### Welcome!

My name is Sandra (_sandrakla97@web.de_) and I am a student at the TU Braunschweig (Master of Biology) with the focus on bioinformatics ðŸ’» 

A wide and interesting field, which brings new challenges every day! Iâ€™m currently working on Shiny Apps and a lot with R (see the [projects](./about.md)).
