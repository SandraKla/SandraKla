### Welcome!

My name is Sandra and I was a student at the TU Braunschweig (Master of Biology, finished Sept 2020) with a focus on Bioinformatics. A broad and interesting field that brings new challenges every day! ðŸŒ±ðŸ”¬ 

I am particularly interested in age-dependent reference intervals. I have developed Shiny Apps on this topic:

- [AdRI](https://github.com/SandraKla/AdRI)
- [AdRI_rpart](https://github.com/SandraKla/AdRI_rpart)
- [Zlog_AdRI](https://github.com/SandraKla/Zlog_AdRI)
- [AdRI_Generator](https://github.com/SandraKla/AdRI_Generator)
- [reflimR_Shiny](https://github.com/SandraKla/reflimR_Shiny)

I have been working on a Shiny App for processing data from the FreeSurfer program for analysing MRI images of the brain (see [ShinySurfer](https://github.com/SandraKla/ShinySurfer)). At work I use databases and __SQL__ to create various GUIs in __C#__ (.NET Framework) and data analysis ðŸ’». In my free time I look at some __HTML__, __CSS__ and __Javascript__ to create websites and learn __Python__ and __Unity__ ðŸŒŽ. 

Over time, I have gained a lot of experience in data science, software development and machine learning. Here is a list of my [projects and publications](./about.md).
