### Welcome!

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sandra and I was a student at the TU Braunschweig (Master of Biology, finished Sept. 2020) with the focus on bioinformatics. A wide and interesting field, which brings new challenges every day! ðŸŒ±ðŸ”¬

Here is a list from my [projects](./about.md).

I have worked in my free time on a Shiny App for Age-dependent Reference Intervals in R and for processing data from the FreeSurfer program for evaluating MRI images of the brain. At work I deal with databases and SQL to create different GUIs in C# (.NET Framework) ðŸ’». In my free time I look at some HTML, CSS and Javascript for creating websites und Python for data analysis ðŸŒŽ. Over time, I have gained a lot of experience in data science, software development and machine learning.
