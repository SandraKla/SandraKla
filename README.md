### Hi there 👋

My name is Sandra (E-Mail: sandrakla97@web.de) and I was a student at the TU Braunschweig (Master of Biology, finished Sept. 2020) with the focus on bioinformatics. A wide and interesting field, which brings new challenges every day! 🌱🔬 

I’m currently working in my free time on a Shiny App for Age-dependent Reference Intervals in R (see [AdRI](https://github.com/SandraKla/Age-dependent-Reference-Intervals)) and for processing data from the FreeSurfer program for evaluating MRI images of the brain (see [ShinySurfer](https://github.com/SandraKla/ShinySurfer)). At work I deal with databases and SQL to create different GUIs in C# to connect to their database 💻

*Next publication:
- *A Tool for Plausibility Checks of Reference Interval Limits* (see [Zlog_AdRI](https://github.com/SandraKla/Zlog_AdRI)) 💉
- *ShinySurfer: A tool for visualization and statistical analysis of cortical parameters* (see [ShinySurfer](https://github.com/SandraKla/ShinySurfer)) 🧠
