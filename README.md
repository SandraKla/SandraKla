### Hi there 👋

My name is Sandra (E-Mail: sandrakla97@web.de) and I was a student at the TU Braunschweig (Master of Biology, finished Sept. 2020) with the focus on bioinformatics. A wide and interesting field, which brings new challenges every day! 🌱🔬 

I’m currently working on a Shiny App for Age-dependent Reference Intervals in R (see [AdRI](https://github.com/SandraKla/Age-dependent-Reference-Intervals)) 💉 
I'm also working on a Shiny App/Package for processing data from the FreeSurfer program for evaluating MRI images of the brain (see [ShinySurfer](https://github.com/SandraKla/ShinySurfer)) 🧠
At work I deal with databases, SQL and C# 💻

*Newest publication:* A Tool for Plausibility Checks of Reference Interval Limits (see [Zlog_AdRI](https://github.com/SandraKla/Zlog_AdRI))
