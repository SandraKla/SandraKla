### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is [Sandra](https://sandrakla.github.io/SandraKla/) and I was a student at the TU Braunschweig (Master of Biology, finished Sept. 2020 ) with the focus on bioinformatics ğŸ’»ğŸŒ±ğŸ”¬

A wide and interesting field, which brings new challenges every day! Iâ€™m currently working on a Shiny App for Age-dependent Reference Intervals (see AdRI) ğŸ’‰ 
I'm also working on a Shiny App for processing data from the FreeSurfer program for evaluating MRI images of the brain (see ShinySurfer) ğŸ§ 
At work I deal with databases, SQL and C# ğŸ’»
